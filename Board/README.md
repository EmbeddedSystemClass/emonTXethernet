# EmonTX Simplified PCB Board

Fully based on the original by OpenEnergyMonitor. Found here: https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx-shield/tree/master/hardware/emontx-shield-smt

Changes include removing all components not connected to the working of the CT Sensor measurements or 9V AC-AC measurement. Same size as other one to increase compatability. 

Making this board is absolutly not required. EmonTX Shield from OpenEnergyMonitor is perfect and even offers the option to also use the radio module. 

## Components 
Components required to build and solder it yourself. I included links to a component website I ordered them from. There are usually many different options available.
